# 🏡 House Price Prediction (Internship Task 1 - Prodigy Infotech)
This project predicts house prices using a simple linear regression model.
It takes square footage, number of bedrooms, and bathrooms as input.
Built using Python and scikit-learn libraries.
Created as Task 1 of my Prodigy Infotech internship.

This project uses **Linear Regression** to predict house prices based on:

- Square Footage (`GrLivArea`)
- Number of Bedrooms (`BedroomAbvGr`)
- Number of Bathrooms (`FullBath`)

## 📁 Files

- `house_price_prediction.py` – Main script to train model and take user input
- `train.csv` – (Optional) Dataset from Kaggle used for training

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Install dependencies:
